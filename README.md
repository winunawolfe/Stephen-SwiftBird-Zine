While the post was shared quite a bit online, I wanted to find a way to share it with others who might not have seen it in their feeds. After gaining their permission, I put together a zine to print for local distribution. That's when I realized I wanted to offer a link to a site where you don't need an account to access the information.

I didn't either, which is precisely why more people need this perspective in mind.
